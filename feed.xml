                <p>I believe there are three types of indie RPG makers: Designers, Writers or Artists. There probably exits many more categorizations but today I will focus on these three. Despite many indie RPG makers needing to work all three of these roles, relatively few actually are experts in all of them. I believe it is useful to recognize which of these skillsets you have and which style of work you prefer.</p>
<pre><em>This is a Feeling &amp; Thought. A series where I write about my experiences in the TTRPG hobby. Just like feelings, these thoughts aren't science, they aren't truth, and they definitely aren't reliable. Explore them with a playful attitude and don't take them too seriously. I certainly don't.</em></pre>
<p><strong>Designers: </strong>The rules-nerds and those obsessed with dice systems. The Designer focuses on the mechanical workings of a system, totally convinced they will be the one to invent the next d20. Designers first and foremost make games over other aspects of the RPG hobby.</p>
<p><strong>Writers: </strong>The content makers and the worldbuilders. The Writer is more than happy to pick up the reliable PbtA 2d6 to make their narrative come to life in a 400-page tome that no-one has time to read. Writers are most interested in making the roleplay part of the RPG acronym.</p>
<p><strong>Artist: </strong>While having some overlap with the Writer, the Artist is more focused on stretching the boundaries of the hobby by making esoteric zines and publications. Their dream is to win the ENNIE for best layout with a game that cannot actually be played. Artists are most interested in using both roleplay and game as a form of artistic expression.</p>
<p>We as RPG makers see lots of games. We like some and dislike others. A lot of it boils down to which of these three archetypes made that particular game and which archetype we find most interesting. Here's some examples all from the same small circle of OSR games:</p>
<p><strong>Shadowdark </strong>is a Designer game. It's layout and art is simplistic black and white and the game really isn't known for it's worldbuilding. The true beauty of Shadowdark is how refined of a gameplay and user experience it is, using great design both in its systems and supportive content to bridge the gap between old-school and modern.</p>
<p><strong>Mausritter </strong>is a Writer game. It uses the brilliant mechanics of Into the Odd to build one of if not the greatest game about tiny woodland critters. Most of Mausritter's charm is built into it's evocative tables and supportive content. People play Mausritter for the mice, not the dice.</p>
<p><strong>Mörk Borg</strong> is an Artist game. It's mechanically sound but barely contains enough to be considered a full fledged game system. It's main draw is the incredible art and layout work by Johan Nohr. While many would find the lack of systems disappointing, Mörk Borg delivers a great grimdark experience with sheer loudness alone.</p>
<p>That's that. Next time you find yourself puzzled by the success of a game, consider who made it and what are it's intentions. Is it trying to deliver in Design, Writing or Art? Which of these three did you expect?  Which one are you?</p>

                <p>This week we had a task to describe the thesis process. I’ve elected to change the title from last week</p><h4 id="enemy-expression-in-bx-derivative-osr-tabletop-roleplaying-games">Enemy Expression in B/X-Derivative OSR Tabletop Roleplaying Games</h4>
<p><em>Team:</em> Solo</p><p><em>Project type:</em> Research project</p><p><em>Technology:</em> Games are books, written on Overleaf using Zotero as reference manager</p><p>The project mostly consists of reading and cataloging a series of tabletop roleplaying game rulebooks. The aim of  the study is to find families of presentation styles for enemy statistics in these games using k-means clustering. I was inspired by the methodology detailed in this post <a href="https://traversefantasy.blogspot.com/2022/12/osr-rules-families-faq-methodology.html?m=1">https://traversefantasy.blogspot.com/2022/12/osr-rules-families-faq-methodology.html?m=1</a></p><p>The main dataset will be limited to any books and pdfs I can get access to. I have a good set already and many games have rules that are freely available. I can use the reference list in the post as a starting point and add in some statistics from rpg.net forum users preferred games to filter out bias.</p><p>Whether I end up with this plan or not shall be seen. I’m already thinking of using the findings from the above link as a basis and instead studying each cluster individually.</p>

                <p>Welcome to my journey to write my Master’s thesis on tabletop roleplaying games. There isn’t much to say at this time but I am required to start with a short summary of my intial topic, so here goes:</p><p>Enemy Balance in B/X-Derivative OSR Tabletop Roleplaying Games</p><p>OSR (old-school revival, renaissance or revolution) is a philosophical movement focused on playing and creating tabletop roleplaying games that recreate the gameplay experience of early editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. A core tenet of this movement is disregard for mathematical balance in enemy design which makes it difficult for new designers to create games and content for this audience. As these games are highly derivative of the original versions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons this thesis studies the similarities and differences in enemy design between these games and their original inspirations.</p><p>Let’s see how this goes</p>
